# Mini Judgment System

A simple judging script (like a minimal Algo-style judge).

## Files

Place the following files in the same directory:

- `input.txt` : input for the program
- `output.txt`: expected output
- `main.py`   : program that reads stdin and writes stdout
- `judge.sh`  : judging script

## How to Run

```sh
chmod +x judge.sh
./judge.sh
